# Modeling Global Development Transitions

This project analyzes how countries move between development stages over time using official World Bank income classifications. By modeling country-level transitions as a Markov process, the project estimates the likelihood of economic advancement, stagnation, or regression.

## Key Questions
- How often do countries transition between income categories?
- Which countries are most likely to escape low-income states?
- What factors correlate with faster development transitions?

## Data Sources
- World Bank Income Classifications
- World Bank Development Indicators
- UN Human Development Index (HDI)

## Methods
- Panel data analysis
- State-based modeling
- Markov transition matrices
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Interactive Plotly visualizations

## Tools
Python, pandas, NumPy, Plotly
